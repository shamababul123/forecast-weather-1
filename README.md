You can see website here:https://github.com/shamababul123/forecast-weather

A basic client-side weather app example.  
Uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to request weather data.

## WORKSHOP
-----------

IDEA - Let's make a super simple weather appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a city and get the current temperature for that city. 

### Ingredients
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML -> the information represented on the page
  * CSS -> the style or look of the information
  * Javacsript -> the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
  * API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data
  * JSON -> the weather data
  * jQuery -> a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us
